## Block Websites in Chromium(blocked websites are in the json file)

Many rules like `iptables`,`nftables`, `/etc/hosts`, doesn't work when I am behind a VPN. VPN is designed to bypass network traffic.

There are many browser extensions to block/redirect websites, except they are pretty crappy, like [this one](https://blocksite.co/). It isn't even free!
